# PaintSHOP Overview

PaintSHOP is a technology that enables the interactive design of modern oligonucleotide FISH experiments at genome and transcriptome-scale.

PaintSHOP is comprised of two components:
1. A scalable machine learning pipeline for probe specifity prediction
2. An interactive Shiny web application for probe design

This repository contains the code for the machine learning pipeline.

A manuscript describing this work is in preparation.

# Description of Pipeline

The pipeline is built to take a set of candidate oligonucleotide (oligo) fluorescent *in-situ hybridization* (FISH) probes, and generate quantitative predictions about the likelihood of the candidates hybridizing with sequences other than their intended target in the genome. Off-target hybridization results in background noise, and makes FISH signal harder to interpret.

Here is a schematic overview of the pipeline:

Detailed descriptions of the pipeline are provided in the PaintSHOP publication. Briefly, the pipeline works by aligning all probe candidates against the genome they are designed for using the [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) NGS aligner with very sensitive parameters. Pairwise alignments are reconstructed using [sam2pairwise](https://github.com/mlafave/sam2pairwise). A gradient boosting regression model implemented with [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is used to predict the probability of the candidate hybridizing at each alignment site based on a thermodynamic partition function. The scores are aggregrated into an on-target and off-target score for each probe in the set.

# Installation & Use

In order to use the pipeline, you first need to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Next, you can run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/elliothershberg/PaintSHOP_pipeline.git && cd PaintSHOP_pipeline/
$ conda env create -f envs/environment.yaml
$ conda activate PaintSHOP_pipeline
```

to clone this repository and create a conda environment with the dependencies required.

The last installation step is to install [sam2pairwise](https://github.com/mlafave/sam2pairwise) following the instructions provided.

You will also need to either create or download a Bowtie2 index and a [Jellyfish](http://www.genome.umd.edu/jellyfish.html) file. Information for downloading pre-computed Bowtie2 indeces or building new indeces can be found [here](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml). The [OligoMiner](https://github.com/brianbeliveau/OligoMiner) repository also provides detailed information on creating Bowtie2 indeces and Jellyfish files.

This pipeline is implemented using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), and distributed according to [best practices](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html). If you are familiar with Snakemake or similar workflow tools, you can edit the config.yaml file to include your information, and run the pipeline. A quick example of the workflow can be found [here](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html). If you are new to Snakemake, the [tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html) is a great place to get started to learn more.
