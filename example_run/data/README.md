# Example Genome Assembly

These sample files serve as an example assembly to test the PaintSHOP pipeline. The files include only a tiny portion of the real genome, and resulting probe files should be used only for software testing purposes.

The example genome sequence is contained in [example.fa](./example.fa) and genome annotations are in [example.gtf](./example.gtf).

These test files were derived from the sacCer3 yeast assembly found [here](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sacCer3/bigZips/). Other assemblies can be found [here](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html).
